## 3. Election-Audit Summary:
This script can be used to determine who the winner of the election is, how many votes they received, and the percentage of votes that makes.
It will also show how many voted their opponents received with their percentages.
We also provided the county with the most votes and how many votes the other counties received for comparison.

With this script we can also determine future elections not only for Colorado, but for other states, or even presidential elections.
	If we needed to look for different states, once we are given the correct information, we can just change "counties" to "states" to determine the which states get the highest number or voters.
We can also determine what counties have the smallest numbers of voters to figure out a way to boost those numbers.
	If we need to search for the lowest counties with the lowest voters numbers, we would need to change "largest" to "lowest" under lines 31-33 for the data to provide those counties that need a boost in voters.
